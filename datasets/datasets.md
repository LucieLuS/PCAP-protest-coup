The Colpus Dataset, created by John Chinn, David B. Carter & Joseph G. Wright
Description: This dataset identifies all military and non-military coup attempts in the world since 1946 through a comprehensive review of related prior datasets, historical documents and secondary literature. It also provides data on the identity of coup leaders and codes whether the coup leaders sought or achieved “regime change” (coups de regime) or “leader reshuffling” (coups de chef).

The Coup d'État Project Dataset

Dataset v2.1.2 - This version of the dataset improves on the data published in December 2022 by adding new coup events and updating the coding of coup events that occurred in 2022 extending the period covered from 1945 to the end of 2022. This version of these data (v2.1.2) contains 981 events (441 successful coups, 349 attempted coups and 191 coup conspiracies).


Codebook v2.1.2 - This 16-page document provides a description of the Cline Center's Coup d’État Project Dataset. The first section of this codebook provides a summary of the different versions of the data. The second section provides a succinct definition of a coup d’état used by the Coup d’État Project and an overview of the categories used to differentiate the wide array of events that meet the project's definition. It also defines coup outcomes. The third section describes the methodology used to produce the data.
