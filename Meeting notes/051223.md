# Discussed possible ways to extend the paper:

Look at more recent coups, and possibly look at the use of social media (image as data to get more info about the protests).

Get better information about the size of protests.

Worry about the small n of coups and coups attempts in Colpus. Basically the N of protests are huge, but the N of protest + coup following up is very small relatively.

Coup success or coup failure (and the role of media)
what happens after coup (gov restrict the media freedom more)? But that presumably when coup attempt fails. Would a new government after the sucess of coup still restrict media freedom etc?
What happen after coup? Do we see more or fewer protests aftafterwarderwards?

We can do better than yearly level: in a monthly level for example, whether larger size protests will have coup following up immediately? Do elites need some more time to make a decision or organize?

# Next step:
(All the datasets mentioned here are in the `datasets` folder)

Take Coups data from Colpus and identify protests 6 months before and after the coups in ACLED. We read the information about these coups, as well as the protests related (or not related) before and after the coups. 

Each of us can start with 5 coups, and next time we come back and discuss. I assign the ids in Colpus dataset to each of us:

Qinglin: 
91-2009-6-28; 101-2002-4-12; 101-2019-4-30; 130-2000-1-21; 135-2000-10-30

Je Hoon:
145-2019-11-10; 150-2000-5-18; 371-2018-4-23; 403-2003-7-16; 403-2022-11-25

Shuyuan: 
404-2003-9-14; 404-2005-5-25; 404-2008-11-23; 404-2012-4-12; 404-2012-10-21

Lucie: 
404-2022-2-1; 420-2014-12-30; 432-2012-3-22; 432-2012-4-30; 432-2020-8-18

If we have time, we can look at the differences between Coup d'etat proects from Cline Center and Colpus. For example, whether these five assiggned coups are included in Coup d'etat projects. Cline center one has code book and source information, so I think it might have more information.

# Meet in one week at the same time.
