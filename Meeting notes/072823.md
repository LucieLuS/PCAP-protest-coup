# What we discussed:

Vairbles we want to include in our datasets -- almost set except the after-coups state-building related variables. Lucie has to check those, as well as the ACLED data set to see if we can get violence level day by day.

# Endogeneity issue we discussed:

## Bidirectional:

too violent ...> condemn: when the coups are too violent, newspapers tend to report and condemn them. (newsworthiness)

condemn ...> violent: when leaders condemn the coups or coups attempts shown in the newspapers, rebel leaders will factor those in and become less violent. (anticipated support level)

It looks like these are two different directions of hypotheses!

one possible solution: to get the daily coverage as well as daily violent level change to get more fine-grained observations.

# sample size

stick with the current one so far because NYT newspapers are from 2000.

# Tasks for getting information about coups (in yellow):

Je Hoon: Coding + 0-5 events
Qinglin: 15-20 events
Lucie: figure out blue columns and code 5.
