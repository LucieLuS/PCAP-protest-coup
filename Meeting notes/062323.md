10,000 articles for coups
Think about how to narrow it down technically 

Does information exposure of protests help the success of the coups? [we focus on the international news … contributing the connections]
Protests + failure/success of coups (DV);
Borrow media bias theory (IV)

More protests (people’s will; inequality; racial/gender related – how news media depict protests differently)
No study on news reports on coups (hard to access data?)
Reference datasets for protests

The most important dataset is our reference dataset
U.S./China
Whether the country is pro-China/pro-U.S.?
Violence/report is skewed

The key issues are to add new variables

Reporting is a signal of whether the news outlets care. They may care about democratic/authoritarian ideology changes. 

Define sentiment in whatever way you want. [use the dictionary approach]
Intensity of reporting
Bias: differences between coups leadership
Mention of ideology/reasons in protests
