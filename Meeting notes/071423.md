# Let's try this new direction

How are coups susceptible to foreign support?

The impact of variations of foreign support level (verbal vs. materialï¼‰ & from whom (NYT, Wall Street, AFP, African Union) on the democratic sides of coups (violence level, success, protests aftermaths,
elections in the state-building).

DV: coups' violence level? Success? leaders holding elections aftermaths?
IV: variations of foreign support level from news reports of coups (Count of news articles, quotes from Foreign policymakers/spokesmen, sentiment, topics)

Endogeneity issues: foreign actors are more likely to support coups that lead the countries to more democratic.


Theoretical: to complement domestic factors, foreign support should matter a lot as well. Coup leaders and state leaders care about whether the new/unstable regimes can get international support. Support can also come from various sources (international organizations, U.S., France, regional organization...).

No pressure (not signify) ----> sled to military/authoritarian regime
Some pressure ----> countries more democratic; hold elections (promises to have elections)
