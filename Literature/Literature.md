## Media Report Bias

"We argue that the nature of reporting bias depends on how news organizations navigate the political context in which they are based. ... We test these propositions using new data on protest and political violence during the 2011 Libyan uprising and daily newspaper coverage of the Arab Spring from 113 countries. We uncover evidence of a status-quo media bias in non-democratic states, and a revisionist bias in democratic states. Media coverage in non-democracies underreported protests and nonviolent collective action by regime opponents, largely ignored government atrocities, and overreported those caused by rebels. We find the opposite patterns in democratic states."

*non-democracies: anti-rebel, pro-government; democracies: pro-government*
*one event, many news outlets*

"How does sourcing affect which events are included in international relations datasets? ... We exploit source variation in the UCDP GED dataset, which includes events from media reports and non-media sources, to explore the bias introduced by including only media reports in international relations datasets. Unlike previous studies, our approach allows us to compare subnational and cross-national determinants of bias. We find that media sources severely underreport events in African countries, and **coverage is also associated with country-level factors like international trade and subnational factors like access to communication technology.** Non-media sources cover a significant number of events not included in media sources; their inclusion can expand coverage and reduce bias in datasets."
